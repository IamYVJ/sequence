// config.js — Where the optional authoritative server lives.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SERVER MODE EXIST. Blank both URLs and
// the app is exactly what it always was: a static peer-to-peer game with no
// backend. That is not a fallback path bolted on afterwards — it is the default,
// it is what runs on a plane, and every piece of server UI is gated behind a live
// health probe so a server that is missing, off or unreachable simply isn't
// offered. See app.server in js/main.js.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TRAILING SLASH ON SERVER_URL IS LOAD-BEARING.
//
// Caddy routes with `handle_path /sequence/*`, which matches `/sequence/` and
// everything under it — but NOT a bare `/sequence`. A WebSocket upgrade to
// `wss://host/sequence` therefore reaches the reverse proxy's fallback rather than
// the game server, and the symptom is a socket that opens and closes with no
// error worth reading. Don't tidy the slash away.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The host below is a Tailscale Funnel address: it terminates TLS with a real
// certificate and is reachable from the public internet, which is why wss:// and
// https:// are correct here and why the server keeps an origin allowlist. The
// client is served from GitHub Pages, so that origin must appear in the server's
// ALLOWED_ORIGINS or every handshake is refused with a 403.
// ============================================================================
