// index.js — The only file that knows this is a network service.
//
// Everything above it is testable without a socket: guards.js is pure policy,
// rooms.js talks to anything with .send(), session.js takes a frame and a clock.
// So this file is deliberately thin, and it is the ONLY file in server/ that
// imports `ws` — which is what keeps `npm test` install-free.
//
// WHERE THIS RUNS
//   In a container on a Raspberry Pi, behind Caddy on 127.0.0.1:8080, behind a
//   Tailscale Funnel on 443. Two consequences shape the code:
//
//   1. PREFIX-AGNOSTIC. Caddy's `handle_path /sequence/*` strips the prefix, so
//      requests arrive here as `/`, `/health`, `/rooms`. Paths are matched on the
//      last segment anyway, because a mismatch between the proxy's idea of the
//      prefix and this server's would otherwise show up as a baffling 404 rather
//      than as a misconfiguration.
//
//   2. THERE IS NO CLIENT IP. Every connection arrives from the proxy, and
//      X-Forwarded-For is whatever the client wrote in it. Per-IP limits would
//      therefore be a comforting fiction, so the caps here are GLOBAL — total
//      connections, total rooms — plus a per-connection token bucket. Those are
//      numbers that are actually true.
